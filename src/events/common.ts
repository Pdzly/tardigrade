      `How do I get my husband to stop going ‚ÄòGoblin Mode‚Äô during sex?

    TLDR; My husband says ‚ÄòGoblin Mode activated‚Äô when we start to have sex, growls and acts like a caveman, and then says ‚ÄòGoblin Mode off‚Äô when we stop, and then pretends not to remember afterward.
    
    I really love my husband and he‚Äôs always been great in bed. But recently he‚Äôs been acting really weird. So, a couple of days ago, my son went on a rampage through our house and said he was in ‚ÄòGoblin Mode‚Äô. We didn‚Äôt really know what to do with him, so we sent him to live with my parents so he can go to a special needs school. My husband a really great relationship with our son and loved him more than anything. Naturally, he was upset when he had to leave. He‚Äôs an incredibly tough man, but this was the first time I‚Äôve ever seen him cry. I think since then, he‚Äôs been a little emotionally unwell. I‚Äôve heard him muttering, ‚ÄòGoblin‚Äô repeatedly when he didn‚Äôt notice me, staring blankly into his food, and just going alone by himself to do who knows what. I feel awful for him, but we both agreed that this was for the best. Last night, the day after our son went away, we decided to have sex to relieve our stress. However, my husband said ‚ÄòGoblin Mode activated‚Äô, starting growling, and went wild having sex with me. Admittedly, it was some of the best and most experimental sex I‚Äôve ever had, but I‚Äôm worried that something might be going on with my husband. Any advice?
    
    Edit: The problem isn‚Äôt the ‚ÄòGoblin Mode‚Äô, it‚Äôs that he could be ill`,

      `I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin

    I don‚Äôt know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it‚Äôs my way of dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I‚Äôll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I‚Äôll walk around my house and pick up various different ‚Äútrinkets‚Äù and put them in my bag while saying stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be having that‚Äù and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice (‚Äútrinkets‚Äù can include anything from shit I find on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire conversation. I‚Äôm 99% sure they don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs me but god that 1% chance is seriously weighing on my mind.`,
